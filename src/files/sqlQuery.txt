Question -
A company maintains the data of its employees in their EMPLOYEE
table. Write a query to print all pairs of employee names where the salary
of the first employee is less than the salary of the second employee.
Sort the output by the increasing order of first employee's ID and second
employee's salary.

Each row in the output must contain:
1. The name of the first employee
2. The name of the second employee, whose salary is more than the
salary of the first employee
